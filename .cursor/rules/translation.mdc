Whenever creating translations from English to Arabic or Turkish, use human, natural-sounding language that fits the context of banknote collection and common website terms.

Accuracy first: Preserve the meaning of the original English sentence without word-for-word literal translations.

Banknote terminology: Use correct, domain-specific terms for coins, notes, currencies, denominations, and collection categories as used by experienced collectors in the target language.

Website basics: Translate navigation, buttons, and UI terms in a way that matches common conventions in Arabic/Turkish websites.

Tone: Keep the tone friendly, clear, and professional. Avoid slang unless explicitly part of the original.

Readability: Ensure the result sounds like it was written by a native speaker, not machine-translated.

Example:

EN: "Add banknote to your collection"

AR: "أضف الورقة النقدية إلى مجموعتك"

TR: "Banknotu koleksiyonuna ekle"
